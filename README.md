# Motion Is Superior

## Setup for development
```
cd MIS-React
npm install
npm start
```

## Read before you use
MIS is currently in development and thus stuff will change constantly. Do not expect your database / library of movies and series to stay unbroken. The database might not work in the later versions of MIS. You might even need to clear up your `IndexedDB` data to be able to use the later versions of MIS.

MIS uses `indexedDB` API to save your data locally on your browser. Thus, if you clean up your browser, your data might dissapear forever.

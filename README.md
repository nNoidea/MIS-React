# Motion Is Superior

MIS is a project that aims to provide a platform for users to track their movies and series they're watching in a fairly easy way with no ads or any interruptions.

The project realies on a frontend built with React and a backend built on CloudFlare Workers. At the moment the backend is not opensource, but it will be in the future if I'm not lazy (feel free to just hack it together yourself, the required endpoints and expected responses are fairly logical).

## Installation Instructions

To set up MIS for development, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the MIS-React directory using the command line:

    ```
    cd MIS-React
    ```3

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
